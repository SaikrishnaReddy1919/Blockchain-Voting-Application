### While interacting with dapp you can only use one account from your metamask account which is a coinbase(there is only one coinbase account for each user) account. That's how metamask is built. This is the intended feature that has been added into metamask. If you have a feature where u can use multiple accounts from your metamask account then there is possibility of misusing the power of blockchain.
EX: Voting Mechanism
-> if a user can use multiple accounts from his metamask to connect with dapp then he can vote to multiple persons
with diff accounts.
